parametrosArchivosES -> Path of the file parameters method Logistic Regression
			Path of the file parameters method Decision Tree
			Path of the file parameters method Random Forest
			Path where the models obtained from the Ensemble Bagging will be stored
			Boolean variable that indicates whether partitions are used or not-> False: no partitions are used, and the next path to put is only the path of the dataset that contains Test and Train together
										             True: partitions are used, and the next routes that are put are those of the partitions, interspersing a train route and a test route

parametrosModelosClass -> The names of the methods you want to use are put by row: SVM, MPC, LogisticRegression, NaiveBayes, RandomForest, DecisionTree, GBT, Isotonic
    When choosing methods, we must take into account how our dataset is, since some work for binary classes, and others for multiclasses. And in each line of the file a method is specified
			  Clasificación:
				- SVM (Binary)
				- MPC (Binary/Multiclass)
				- LogisticRegression (Binary)
				- NaiveBayes (Binary/Multiclass)
				- RandomForest (Binary/Multiclass)
				- DecisionTree (Binary/Multiclass)
			  Regresión:
				- RandomForest (Real)
				- DecisionTree (Real)
				- GBT (Real)
				- Isotonic (Real)
						  

parametrosNumericos -> Parameter indicating how much percentage of the actual dataset will remain for Train. Taking into account that we use a dataset with Test and Train together
		       Parameter indicating how much percentage of the actual dataset will remain for Test. Taking into account that we use a dataset with Test and Train together
		       Number of classifiers that we want to run
		       Percentage of the Train dataset that will have our subdatasets that will be sent to each classifier
		       Number of internal Spark partitions
					   
parametrosCR -> Parameter that will indicate if we want a classification or a regression to be performed in our Ensemble. It should be put: classification or regression
                In case of regression, the methods of the file parametrosModelosClass can only be: DecisionTree and RandomForest, since they are the ones implemented for this type of datasets
				
parametrosLogisticRegression -> Maximum number of iterations
				Regularization parameter
				ElasticNet mixing parameter. For alpha = 0, the penalty is an L2 penalty. For alpha = 1, it is an L1 penalty. For alpha at (0,1), the penalty is a combination of L1 and L2. The default value is 0.0, which is an L2 penalty
					
parametrosRandomForest -> Number of maximum categories Vector Indexer
			  Number of trees
						  
parametrosDecisionTree -> Number of maximum categories Vector Indexer
